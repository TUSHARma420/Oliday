                    folder, just in case, and add our email address
                    Oliday@help.com
                    - to your address book so that it doesn't get filtered out next time. In the meantime, contact us at

            <div class="faq-body">
                <p>Short answer-it depends. Long answer-the cancellation charges depend on the hotel, time of stay ('season' time, 'off season' time), and time of cancellation. To know what's applicable in your case, check the hotel's booking policy mentioned on the booking page while making the reservation (in case you missed it, you can always sign in to your Oliday Account and check it out on your Trips pages). Apart from the cancellation charges levied by the hotel, Oliday charges a fee of Rs. 300 for every hotel cancellation.</p>
